The goal of this project is to implement the CNN from scratch for a very basic toy dataset, MNIST. The main objective is to have the modern resnet architecture running across 3 gpu node, 1 gpu and 1 cpu. Comparing the speeds, gpu utilization, and benefits of why multiple gpus help train bigger network and how cuda optimizations help here. Secondly, its important to note how weights evolve across the layers during train. understanding, batch norm, residual block. Thus, at the end of it, there should be a good understanding of the deconstruction framework with reasonable understanding of whats inside cnns. The reason why ccns are choosen is because vision as a modality is easier to visualize mentally and see the filters that are being developed and which features are getting detected across the layers. Its lines, shapes and geometry. whereas with words its more like you are trying to visualize and see how entire information and concepts and their associations in the world has been captured. This would make it much more difficult to under understand the layers.
