Your overall line of thought and reasoning to approach model interpretability through the implementation and analysis of a CNN on the MNIST dataset is very solid. Here's an affirmation and some additional thoughts to help refine your approach:

### Affirmation of Your Approach

1. **Choice of Vision as Modality:**
   - Using vision and MNIST for interpretability is an excellent choice. Visual data is intuitive and the evolution of features through the layers of a CNN can be effectively visualized.

2. **Focus on Modern Architecture:**
   - Implementing a ResNet architecture is a great idea. The residual connections in ResNet are key innovations that not only improve training but also help in understanding how information flows through deep networks.

3. **Hardware Comparison:**
   - Comparing training across different hardware configurations (CPU, single GPU, multiple GPUs) will provide valuable insights into the computational efficiency and scalability of deep learning models.

4. **Weight Evolution and Feature Detection:**
   - Analyzing how weights evolve and how different layers detect features is crucial for interpretability. Visualizing filters and feature maps helps understand what the network learns at each stage.

5. **Understanding Core Components:**
   - Deep diving into batch normalization and residual blocks will provide a comprehensive understanding of the components that make modern deep networks trainable and efficient.

### Suggestions for Improved Interpretability Approach

1. **Layer-wise Visualization:**
   - Visualize the outputs of each layer (feature maps) for a few sample images. This helps in understanding what kind of features (edges, textures, patterns) each layer is focusing on.
   - Use techniques like Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) to visualize which parts of the input image contribute most to the network’s decisions.

2. **Filter Visualization:**
   - Visualize the learned filters of the initial layers directly. In CNNs, the filters in the first few layers often resemble edge detectors and simple patterns.

3. **Dimensionality Reduction for High-Dimensional Layers:**
   - Use dimensionality reduction techniques like t-SNE or PCA to visualize high-dimensional activations and how they evolve during training.

4. **Activation Maximization:**
   - Use activation maximization to generate images that strongly activate particular neurons. This can help in understanding the kind of features each neuron is detecting.

5. **Intermediate Outputs:**
   - Save and analyze intermediate outputs during training to observe how the representations change over epochs. This can provide insights into how the network gradually learns to distinguish between different classes.

6. **Saliency Maps:**
   - Generate and analyze saliency maps to see which parts of an image are most influential in the network’s predictions. This can help identify biases and understand decision-making processes.

7. **Adversarial Examples:**
   - Explore how the network responds to adversarial examples. This can reveal vulnerabilities and help understand the robustness of the learned features.

8. **Regularization and Generalization:**
   - Experiment with different regularization techniques (dropout, L2 regularization) and observe their effects on feature learning and generalization.

### Key Takeaways

Yes, your point about focusing on CNNs instead of language models for interpretability is well-founded, especially considering the current context and objectives of your project. Here's why this makes sense and some additional thoughts:

### Why Focusing on CNNs is a Good Choice

1. **Intuitiveness of Visual Data:**
   - Visual data is inherently more intuitive to interpret. You can directly see what the model is learning by visualizing filters, feature maps, and other intermediate outputs.
   - For example, edge detection filters in early layers and more complex patterns in deeper layers can be easily visualized and understood.

2. **Ease of Visualization:**
   - The progression of learning from simple to complex features in images is straightforward to visualize. Techniques like saliency maps, Grad-CAM, and activation maximization provide clear visual representations.
   - Visualizing the changes and activations in CNNs helps in understanding what the network is focusing on at each layer.

3. **Simpler to Explain:**
   - Explaining concepts like convolution, pooling, and feature detection in images is generally easier than explaining abstract embeddings and contextual relationships in language models.
   - The geometric and spatial nature of image data allows for more tangible explanations.

4. **Established Interpretability Techniques:**
   - There are many well-established techniques for interpreting CNNs, such as filter visualization, feature map visualization, and layer-wise activations. These techniques can be directly applied to gain insights into the model's workings.

### Challenges with Language Models

1. **Abstract Nature of Text:**
   - Language models deal with abstract, high-dimensional spaces where understanding the learned representations can be more challenging.
   - Words and phrases need to be contextualized, and embeddings represent complex relationships that are harder to visualize and interpret.

2. **Complex Relationships:**
   - Language models capture syntactic and semantic relationships that are not as easily visualized as the spatial hierarchies in images.
   - Interpreting attention mechanisms, for example, requires understanding how the model weighs different parts of the input text, which is more abstract than visual feature detection.

3. **Higher Dimensionality:**
   - Text embeddings and attention mechanisms operate in very high-dimensional spaces, making visualization and interpretation more complex.

### Practical Benefits

1. **Visualization Tools:**
   - There are many tools and libraries specifically designed for visualizing and interpreting CNNs, such as TensorBoard, Grad-CAM, and others.
   - These tools can provide immediate visual feedback, making it easier to understand and debug the model.

2. **Educational Value:**
   - For educational purposes, CNNs provide a clear, visual way to understand how neural networks process and learn from data.
   - Seeing the progression of feature learning from edges to complex shapes in images helps build a strong foundational understanding of neural networks.

### Conclusion

Focusing on CNNs for your project makes a lot of sense due to the intuitiveness and visual nature of image data. It allows for straightforward interpretation and visualization, which is crucial for understanding how neural networks learn and make decisions. By starting with CNNs, you build a strong foundation in neural network interpretability, which can later be extended to more complex and abstract domains like language models if desired.
